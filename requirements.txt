# Curvelet Capital - requirements.txt
# Signals / analytics / execution + Flask app
# ============================

# --- Core numerical / scientific ---
numpy                 # arrays, vectorized math
pandas                # time series, DataFrames
scipy                 # signal processing, stats

# --- Visualization ---
matplotlib            # plotting
plotly                # interactive charts

# --- Market data ---
yfinance              # Yahoo Finance fetcher

# --- Pricing / curves ---
quantlib              # pricing (QuantLib-Python bindings)
rateslib              # rate curves / analytics

# --- Multi-scale signal processing ---
PyWavelets            # wavelet transforms (1D/2D)
# pyshearlab            # shearlets (curvelet-family) – may need source install

# --- Data files / compression ---
pyarrow               # parquet I/O and columnar memory model

# --- Broker APIs (legit/robust) ---
schwab-api            # Schwab Developer API (REST/OAuth)
# ib-insync             # Interactive Brokers API
# alpaca-trade-api      # Alpaca brokerage/trading
# tastytrade            # Tastytrade API (options-friendly)

# --- HTTP / streaming helpers ---
requests              # REST calls
requests-cache        # HTTP cache (avoid API throttling)
websocket-client      # streaming quotes

# --- Config / secrets ---
python-dotenv         # load .env for keys

# --- Web app (Flask) ---
Flask                 # web framework
Flask-Caching         # cache (simple/redis)
Flask-Cors            # CORS if SPA hits API
gunicorn              # prod WSGI server (Linux/macOS)
waitress              # prod server (Windows-friendly, pure-Python)
Jinja2                # templating (pulled by Flask, explicit for clarity)

# --- Quality Assurance / Backtesting ---
backtesting           # backtest engine
vectorbt              # vectorized backtesting / analysis
pytest                # testing
pytest-mock           # mocking for tests

# --- Optional tasking / scheduling (uncomment if needed) ---
# APScheduler          # timed jobs (polling, heartbeats)
# redis                # backing store for cache/queues
